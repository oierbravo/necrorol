Accurate,"The standard rule that an attack roll of natural 1 automatically misses is ignored for attacks made with weapons that have this trait. If an attack would hit on a 1+ or better  the roll of a 1 hits."
Area,"Mark the location where an attack made by a weapon with this trait hit with a counter. An area extends 2.5'' out from the centre of the counter; a 5'' Blast marker can be used to determine this area  but it should be considered to extend vertically as well as horizontally. Fighters already in the area when the attack is made  fighters who start or end their turn in the area  and fighters who move through the area are all automatically hit by the area. In the End Phase roll a D6; on a 3 or less the area dissipates and the counter is removed."
Attachment,"This weapon does not count against the fighter's maximum number of carried weapons. If the weapon has an Unattached profile  it may be unattached as a Basic action; while unattached the unattached profile is used. An unattached item can be reattached as a Simple action."
Backstab,"If the attacker is not within the target's vision arc  add 1 to the attack's Strength."
Blast (3''),"The weapon uses a 3” Blast marker."
Blast (5''),"The weapon uses a 5” Blast marker."
Blaze,"After an attack with the Blaze trait has been resolved roll a D6 if the target was hit but not taken Out of Action. On a 4  5 or 6 the target catches fire; place a Blaze marker on their fighter card. At the end of each of their own activations a fighter who remains on fire suffers a Strength 3  AP -1 and if they are not prone the fighter becomes Broken and begins Running for Cover. A fighter with a Blaze marker on their fighter card may make the Stop Drop and Roll (Double) action; if they do the fighter becomes Pinned (if they are not already prone); roll a D6 and add 1 to the result for each friendly Active fighter within 1''. On a 3+ the fire is extinguised; remove the Blaze token. On a 1 or 2 the fighter remains on fire and their activation ends.Friendly fighters within 1'' of a fighter with a Blaze marker on their fighter card may make the Extinguish Blaze (Basic) action; if they do roll a D6. On a 1 is rolled the friendly fighter catches fire as well; place a Blaze token on their fighter card and thier activation ends. On a 4+ the fire is extinguised; remove the Blaze token from the on fire fighter."
Blinding,"If a fighter is hit by a Blinding weapon  make an Initiative check for the target. If it is failed they are blinded. A blinded fighter loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker  they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the fighter is activated  they cannot make any attacks other than reaction attacks  for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6. Photo-goggles or similar equipment the target has can be used to help resist this effect."
Combi,"Combi-weapons have multiple profiles. Any one of the weapon's profiles that are not Out of Ammo may be used when an attack is made with the weapon. However  when making an Ammo check with a Combi weapon two dice are rolled and the lower result is taken."
Deadly,"If a Lasting Injury roll would be made for a fighter put Out of Action by an attack with a weapon that has the Deadly trait  instead a D6 is rolled for that fighter. If the result is a 6 the fighter suffers a Memorable Death  otherwise the fighter suffers a Critical Injury."
Demolition,"Grenades with the Demolition trait can be used when making close combat attacks against scenery targets (such as locked doors or scenario objectives). A fighter who uses a grenade in this way makes one attack (regardless of how many Attack dice they would normally roll)  which hits automatically."
Discharged,"After each use this weapon is treated as having failed an Ammo Check. There is no need to roll the Firepower dice unless the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (x) trait. The weapon can be reloaded or reset for later use within the battle as normal (unless it also has the Scarce trait or Limited trait). When using a weapon with this trait in close combat  it can only have one Attack dice allocated to it. Any other Attack dice that would have been allocated to it are allocated to the fighter's other weapon instead  or if the attacker does not have another weapon they are made as unarmed attacks."
Drag,"If a fighter is hit by a Drag weapon but not taken Out of Action  the attacker can attempt to drag the target closer after the attack has been resolved. If they do roll a d6; if the result is equal to or higher than the target's Strength the target is dragged D3'' straight towards the attacker  stopping if they hit any terrain. If the target moves into another fighter (other than the attacker)  both fighters are moved the remaining distance towards the attacker. If the weapon also has the Impale special rule and hits more than one fighter  only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged."
Enervating,"When a fighter is hit by an attack made by an Enervating weapon  they are not Pinned and a wound roll is not made. Instead roll a D6; if the result of the roll is greater than the fighter's current Toughness or is a natural 6  they take a Flesh Wound (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). If a fighter is removed from the battle after being reduced to 0 Toughness by an Enervating weapon no Lasting Injury roll is made; the fighter goes into recovery."
Entangle,"Hits scored by weapons with the Entangle trait cannot be negated by the Parry trait. In addition  if the hit roll for an Entangle weapon is a natural 6  any Reaction attacks made by the target have an additional -2 hit modifier."
Fear,"When the target of an attack with this trait is hit  they must make a Nerve test with a -2 modifier to their result. If the test is failed the target immediately becomes Broken and must make a Running for Cover roll to determine how far away they run from the source of this attack. A Pinned fighter who fails their Nerve test will stand up before Running for Cover. This trait has no effect on Seriously Injured fighters or targets that do not make Nerve tests."
Flash,"As the Blinding trait  but Flash attacks do not cause hits on fighters  do not cause Pinning  and cannot inflict Wounds"
Gas,"When a fighter is hit by an attack made by a Gas weapon  they are not Pinned and a wound roll is not made; instead roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target's current Toughness or is a natural 6  make an Injury roll for that fighter (regardless of the fighter's Wounds characteristic). No save roll can be made by the fighter against this attack."
Grenade,"Grenades are treated as a special type of ranged weapon. A Grenade may be thrown by an Active fighter as a Shoot action. Grenades do not have a Short range  and their Long range is determined by the attacking fighter's Strength. The Firepower dice is not rolled when attacking with a Grenade; an Ammo check must be rolled after each attack made with a Grenade. The Reload (Simple) Action cannot be taken on a weapon profile with the Grenade trait."
Heavy-G,"Heavy-G attacks do not cause hits on fighters  do not cause Pinning  and cannot inflict Wounds; instead mark the location on the battlefield where a Heavy-G attack hits with a counter. An area of increased gravity and magnetic interference extends 2.5'' out from the center of the counter; a 5'' Blast marker can be used to determine this area  but it should be considered to extend vertically as well as horizontally. Fighters can move through the affected area  but all movement is halved (rounding down); Squats are immune to this reduction in movement. Additionally  ranged attacks across the affected area suffer a -1 penalty to hit and have their Strength reduced by 1. Don't roll a Scatter die for Blast weapons that miss a point within 6'' of the affected area  instead move the Blast marker the indicated distance towards the affected area. In the End Phase roll a D6; on a 3 or less the area dissipates and the counter is removed."
Impale,"If an attack made by this weapon hits and wounds the target  and the save roll is unsuccessful (or no save roll is made)  the projectile continues through them and might hit another fighter! Trace a straight line from the target  directly away from the attacker. If there are any fighters within 1'' of this line  and within the weapon's Long Range  the one that is closest to the target is at risk of being hit. Roll a D6; on a 3 or more resolve the weapon's attack against that fighter subtracting 1 from the Strength. The projectile can continue through multiple fighters in this way  but if the Strength is reduced to 0  it cannot hit any more fighters."
Intimidating,"Any fighter who must make a Nerve test due to a friendly fighter being taken Out of Action by an Intimidating weapon suffers a -2 penalty to their Nerve test."
Knockback,"If the hit roll for a weapon with the Knockback trait is equal to or higher than the target's Strength (before any modifiers are applied)  they are immediately moved 1” directly away from the attacking fighter. If the fighter cannot be moved the full 1” because of a wall  obstacle or another fighter  they move as far as possible and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1."
Knockback (Blast),"If the hit roll for a weapon with the Knockback trait is equal to or higher than the target's Strength (before any modifiers are applied)  they are immediately moved 1” directly away from the attacking fighter. If the fighter cannot be moved the full 1” because of a wall  obstacle or another fighter  they move as far as possible and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1.If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait  roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than their Strength they are Knocked Back as described above; however they are moved directly away from the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base  roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are moved."
Knockback (Melee),"If the hit roll for a weapon with the Knockback trait is equal to or higher than the target's Strength (before any modifiers are applied)  they are immediately moved 1” directly away from the attacking fighter. If the fighter cannot be moved the full 1” because of a wall  obstacle or another fighter  they move as far as possible and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1.If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait  the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target up moving directly towards them after they have been Knocked Back to remain in base contact. If the attack was made across a barricade  the attacker cannot do this."
Knockout,"When a fighter is reduced to 0 Wounds by this weapon no Injury roll is made; instead the fighter immediately goes Out of Action and is removed from play. However no Lasting Injury roll is made for the fighter and they will recover in time for the next battle."
Limited,"If an Ammo check is failed for a weapon profile with the Limited trait  the weapon profile is deleted from the Fighter card immediately. Do not recalculate the fighter's rating until the Update Roster step of the Post-Battle Sequence."
Melee,"This weapon can be used during close combat attacks."
Melta,"A weapon with this trait may be used to make a ranged attack against a targeted spot on the battlefield within its short range  exactly as if it has the Blast trait. However  instead of using a Blast template place a Pitfall Crater at the spot on the battlefield hit  underneath any fighters and removing any scatter terrain in that space from the battlefield."
Noisy,"All opposing sentrys within 12'' are alerted immediately if this weapon is used."

Pistol,"Pistols can be used to make ranged attacks  and can also be used in close combat. If a Pistol has an Accuracy modifier  it applies to ranged attacks only."
Plentiful,"Ammunition for this weapon is incredibly common. When reloading it no Ammo check is required  the weapon is automatically reloaded."
Power,"The weapon is surrounded by a crackling power field. Attacks made by Power weapons cannot be parried except by other Power weapons. In addition  if the hit roll for a Power weapon is a 6  no save roll can be made against the attack and its Damage is increased by 1."
Pulverize,"After making an Injury roll for an attack made by this weapon  the attacking player can roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target's unmodified Toughness  or is a natural 6  they can change one Injury dice from a Flesh Wound result to a Serious Injury result."
Radiation,"When a fighter is hit by an attack made by a Radiation weapon  the attacker rolls D6; if the result is higher than the target's current Toughness or is a natural 6 the target fighter takes a Flesh Wound (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). Do not make a Lasting Injury roll for a fighter taken Out of Action by a weapon with this trait; instead that fighter suffers the Enfeebled Injury."
Rapid Fire (X),"When firing with a Rapid Fire weapon  a successful hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition the controlling player can roll more than one Firepower dice  up to the number shown in brackets (for example  when firing a Rapid Fire (2) weapon  up to two firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo check for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail  the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail  the gun has jammed and cannot be used for the rest of the battle.If a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit  the hits can be split between multiple targets. The first must be allocated to the initial target  but the remainder can be allocated to other fighters within 3" of the first who are also within range and line of sight. These must not be any harder to hit than the original target...for example if a target in the open is hit  an obscured target cannot have hits allocated to it. Allocate all of the hits before making any wound rolls.Rapid Fire also works in close combat when on a weapon that also has the Pistol trait."
Rapid Fire (1),"When firing with a Rapid Fire weapon  a successful hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice.If a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit  the hits can be split between multiple targets. The first must be allocated to the initial target  but the remainder can be allocated to other fighters within 3" of the first who are also within range and line of sight.

Smoke,"Smoke weapons do not cause hits on fighters  they do not cause Pinning and cannot inflict Wounds. Instead mark the location where they hit with a counter. They generate an area of dense smoke  which extends 2.5'' out from the center of the counter; a 5'' Blast marker can be used to determine this area  but it should be considered to extend vertically as well as horizontally. Fighters can move through the smoke  but it blocks line of sight and a fighter who is in the smoke effectively has no vision arc.
